# Black Circuit Design, Inc.
**Architectural consulting, systems design, and applied engineering**

I’m **Brian Richardson**, operating under **Black Circuit Design, Inc.** — a small, highly technical consultancy focused on clear, scalable architecture and well-designed systems.

## What I do

**Enterprise & Solution Architecture**  
End-to-end system design, modernization, and architecture documents that developers can actually follow.

**Infrastructure Engineering**  
Kubernetes, Linux, automation, security patterns, cloud integration, and building environments that small teams can maintain.

**Software & Systems Modelling**  
Domain-driven design, event/message-driven architecture, and high-coherence modular systems.

**Technical Writing & Concept Design**  
Clear, structured documentation, architectural roadmaps, and narrative/technical integration when needed.

## Current Work

Most of my active engineering lives in:

- **Aetheric Forge** – private infrastructure stack (automation, K8s, self-hosted services)  
- **Parallel You** – architecture-driven personal OS / productivity platform  
- **Baator World** – simulation engine + technical storytelling framework

While these are personal projects, they demonstrate the technical approach Black Circuit brings into commercial work:  
**clarity, reproducibility, reduced complexity, and systems that scale without chaos.**

## How I work

- Languages & tools: `Python · Kubernetes · Linux · Ansible · Docker · Git · YAML`  
- Design principles: clear boundaries, intentional abstractions, message-focused communication, small-team maintainability  
- Values: honesty, precision, low-drama engineering
